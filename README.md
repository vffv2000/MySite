# MySite
Write a description for a website developed in Django. Also mention that it was my first website and not all of the potential of this framework was explored. HTML and CSS were also used.
This website was developed using the Django framework, as well as HTML and CSS languages. It was my first website on this framework, so it doesn't fully reveal all the functionality and possibilities that can be used in Django.
The website includes several pages where users can view information about the company, products and services offered by this company. The site also contains a feedback form that allows users to send messages and ask questions.
Using the Django framework significantly simplified the website development process, as many tasks such as working with databases and processing requests are automated and integrated into the framework. This allows developers to quickly and efficiently create quality websites.
